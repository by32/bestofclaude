**Language-Specific Examples:**

**TypeScript/React:**
```markdown
**Component Patterns:**
- Use functional components with hooks (no class components)

```

**Python:**
```markdown
**Code Style:**
- Follow PEP 8 with line length of 88 characters (Black formatter)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Use dataclasses for simple data structures
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting
- Use pathlib for file operations (not os.path)
```

**Go:**
```markdown
**Code Style:**
- Follow official Go style guide
- Use gofmt and golangci-lint
- Interface names should end with 'er' (e.g., Reader, Writer)
- Package names should be lowercase, single word
- Use contexts for cancellation and timeouts
```

### üîß Development Workflow
**Purpose:** Standardizes commands and processes across team members.

**Customization Tips:**
- Include all custom npm scripts or make targets
- Document any unusual setup requirements
- Specify database seeding or migration procedures

```

**Microservices with Docker:**
```bash
# Start all services with dependencies
docker-compose up -d

# Start specific service for development
docker-compose up postgres redis
npm run dev

- Include escalation procedures and contacts

### 3. **Balance Detail vs. Brevity**
- Be specific enough to prevent misunderstandings
- Avoid over-documenting obvious conventions
- Focus on decisions that aren't obvious from code
- Include rationale for unusual or controversial choices

### 4. **Use Examples Liberally**

- Version control all changes

### 4. **Ignoring Team Input**
- Involve the whole team in creating the file
- Get feedback on conventions and standards
- Update based on real usage patterns
- Make it a living document, not a one-time effort

## Measuring Effectiveness

Track these metrics to see if your CLAUDE.md is working:

- **Reduced clarification questions** from Claude about project conventions
- **Consistent code style** across Claude-generated code
- **Fewer code review comments** on style and convention issues
- **Faster development velocity** as Claude understands project patterns
- **Better adherence to security and performance standards**

Remember: The goal is to make Claude as effective as a well-onboarded team member who understands your project's conventions, constraints, and goals!
