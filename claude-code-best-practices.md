```

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Understanding New Codebases
- **Start broad**: Ask about project structure and architecture
- **Dive specific**: Request explanations of coding conventions and patterns
- **Build context**: Ask for a glossary of project-specific terms
- **Use navigation**: Leverage `@` to quickly reference files and directories

### 2. Problem-Solving Approach
- **Be specific**: Share exact error messages and reproduction steps
- **Ask for options**: Request multiple fix recommendations
- **Verify changes**: Always run tests after implementations
- **Incremental changes**: Refactor in small, testable increments

### 3. Code Navigation Techniques
- Use `@filename` or `@directory/` for quick file references
- Ask Claude to find relevant code files for specific functionality
- Trace execution flows and component interactions
- Identify legacy or deprecated code for modernization

### 4. Advanced Workflows
- **Extended thinking**: Use keywords like 'think', 'think harder', or 'ultrathink' for deeper analysis
- **Resume conversations**: Use `--continue` and `--resume` flags to pick up previous sessions
- **Custom slash commands**: Create reusable commands in `.claude/commands/` directories
- **Parallel sessions**: Use Git worktrees for multiple concurrent tasks
- **Real-time interaction**: Send additional messages while Claude is working by hitting Enter

## Memory Management

### Memory Types & Hierarchy
1. **Project memory** (`./CLAUDE.md`): Team-shared instructions
2. **User memory** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Personal preferences across projects
3. **Deprecated**: Local project memory (`./CLAUDE.local.md`)

### Best Practices for Memory
- **Be specific**: Use precise instructions like "Use 2-space indentation"
- **Structure well**: Use markdown with bullet points and headings
- **Review regularly**: Periodically update memories for relevance
- **Import additional files**: Use `@path/to/import` syntax
- **Quick additions**: Start input with `#` to quickly add to Claude's memory
- **Use `/memory` command**: Edit memory files directly in your system editor

### Recommended Memory Content
```markdown
# Project Guidelines
- Use 2-space indentation for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow conventional commit format
- Run `npm test` before committing
- Use kebab-case for component files

# Frequently Used Commands
- Test command: `npm test`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Lint command: `npm run lint`

# Architecture Notes
- API endpoints in `/src/api/`
- React components in `/src/components/`
- Utilities in `/src/utils/`
```

## Configuration & Settings

### Configuration Hierarchy
Settings are applied in order of precedence:
1. Enterprise policies (managed by system administrators)
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

### Key Configuration Areas

#### Essential Settings
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowedCommands": ["npm", "git", "pytest"],
    "restrictedDirectories": ["/etc", "/usr"]
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development",
    "DEBUG": "true"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "beforeToolCall": "echo 'Running tool...'",
    "afterToolCall": "echo 'Tool completed'"
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Management Commands
```bash
claude config list                    # List all settings
claude config get permissions         # View specific setting
claude config set model claude-3-5    # Change a setting
claude config set --global model ...  # Set global configuration
```

## IDE Integrations

### Supported IDEs
- **Visual Studio Code** (and forks: Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium)
- **JetBrains IDEs** (IntelliJ, PyCharm, Android Studio, etc.)
- **Any IDE with terminal access**

### Key Features
- **Quick launch**: Keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+Esc)
- **Context sharing**: Automatic sharing from current IDE selection/tab
- **Diff viewing**: View changes directly in IDE
- **File references**: Quick file navigation shortcuts
- **Error sharing**: Automatic diagnostic error sharing

### Setup Best Practices
1. **Install from project root**: Always run `claude` from your project's root directory
2. **Use integrated terminal**: Run Claude in the IDE's built-in terminal
3. **Configure diff tool**: Set to "auto" for automatic IDE detection
4. **Restart completely**: After plugin installation, fully restart your IDE

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure CLI commands are available in PATH
- Check plugin/extension permissions
- Verify running from correct project directory
- Use `/config` command to adjust IDE-specific preferences

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### MCP Overview
MCP enables Claude to access external tools and data sources through specialized servers.

### Server Scope Best Practices
- **Local scope**: Personal servers and experimental configurations
- **Project scope**: Team-shared servers and collaboration tools  
- **User scope**: Personal utilities across multiple projects

### Security Considerations
- **Use caution**: Third-party MCP servers carry inherent risks
- **Minimize exposure**: Be cautious with internet-connected servers
- **Guard against injection**: Watch for potential prompt injection risks
- **Start read-only**: Begin with read-only access for sensitive systems

### Configuration Tips
```bash
# Add MCP servers
claude mcp add server-name command-to-run

# Reference resources
@server:protocol://resource/path

# Use server prompts as slash commands
/server-command
```

### Authentication Best Practices
- Use OAuth 2.0 for remote servers
- Securely store authentication tokens
- Enable automatic token refresh
- Configure appropriate timeout values

## Security Best Practices

### Core Security Principles
- **Read-only by default**: Strict permissions with explicit approval required
- **Folder restrictions**: Access limited to current project directory
- **Command allowlisting**: Approve safe commands explicitly
- **Accept Edits mode**: Controlled change approval workflow

### Prompt Injection Prevention
- **Explicit approval**: Required for sensitive operations
- **Context analysis**: Automatic detection of harmful instructions
- **Input sanitization**: Automatic cleaning of user inputs
- **Web-fetch blocking**: Risky web commands are blocked

### User Security Practices
- **Review commands**: Always verify suggested commands before approval
- **Avoid untrusted input**: Don't pipe untrusted content directly to Claude
- **Verify critical changes**: Double-check modifications to important files
- **Use virtual machines**: For external tool calls and testing
- **Report issues**: Alert Anthropic to suspicious behavior

### Additional Safeguards
- Network request approval by default
- Isolated context windows for web operations
- Trust verification for new codebases
- Secure credential storage (e.g., macOS Keychain)
- Fail-closed command matching
- XDG_CONFIG_HOME compliance for organized configuration
- 30-day data retention policy for feedback transcripts
- No training data usage from user interactions

## Monitoring & Usage Tracking

### OpenTelemetry Integration
Enable comprehensive monitoring with environment variables:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint
export OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID=true
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Usage metrics**: Session counts, active development time
- **Code changes**: Modifications, pull requests, commits
- **Performance**: Token usage, API request costs
- **Tool usage**: Decision patterns and tool effectiveness

### Configuration Best Practices
- **Start simple**: Begin with console debugging
- **Gradual enhancement**: Add sophisticated exporters incrementally
- **Control cardinality**: Manage performance and storage costs
- **Enterprise setup**: Use managed settings for centralized configuration

### Security Considerations
- Telemetry is opt-in by default
- Sensitive information is not logged
- User prompt content is redacted unless explicitly enabled

```bash
/deploy    # Custom deployment command
/test-all  # Comprehensive testing suite
/review    # Code review checklist
```

### Parallel Development
Use Git worktrees for concurrent work:
```bash
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
cd ../feature-branch
claude  # Work on feature in parallel
```

### CI/CD Integration
Use Claude as a code reviewer or linter:
```bash
# In CI pipeline
claude --output json "Review this PR for security issues"
```

#### Example Custom Command Structure
```markdown
---
args:
  - name: component_name
    description: Name of the React component to create
---

# Create React Component

Create a new React component named {{component_name}} following our project conventions:

@src/components/BaseComponent.tsx
@docs/component-guidelines.md

think harder about the component structure and dependencies
```

### Performance and Efficiency Patterns
- **Batch operations**: Combine multiple related tasks in single Claude sessions
- **Context reuse**: Leverage memory and configuration to avoid repeating setup
- **Resource optimization**: Monitor token usage and optimize prompt efficiency
- **Incremental development**: Build features in small, testable chunks with immediate feedback

> — Anthropic Engineering Team

This principle should guide how you structure tasks and provide context to Claude for optimal results.

## Industry Expert Insights

These patterns emerge from experienced practitioners using AI coding tools in production environments.

### Agentic Coding Patterns (Armin Ronacher)

#### Workflow Philosophy
- **Full permission approach**: Use AI agents with comprehensive permissions to minimize human interruption
- **Token efficiency**: Optimize for fast tool responses and efficient token usage
- **Code simplicity**: Prioritize simple, stable, and observable code over complex abstractions

#### Language and Technology Choices
- **Go for backends**: Explicit context system, straightforward test caching, structural interfaces, low ecosystem churn
- **Avoid complex ORMs**: Prefer plain SQL for clarity and AI understanding
- **Minimize dependencies**: Favor code generation over adding external dependencies

#### Tool Design for AI
- **Fast, user-friendly tools**: Build tools that handle unexpected AI behavior gracefully
- **Extensive logging**: Help agents diagnose issues and navigate codebases effectively
- **Process management**: Prevent duplicate service launches and resource conflicts
- **Stable interfaces**: Design APIs that work reliably with AI-generated code

#### Code Design Principles
- **"Dumbest possible thing"**: Write the simplest code that works effectively
- **Clear function names**: Prefer descriptive functions over complex class hierarchies
- **Local visibility**: Keep important checks (permissions, validation) visible and local
- **Proactive refactoring**: Refactor as project complexity grows to maintain AI comprehension

### LLM Coding Effectiveness (Simon Willison)

#### Realistic Expectations
- **Fancy autocomplete**: Treat LLMs as sophisticated autocomplete, not perfect code generators
- **Augmentation tool**: Use to enhance your abilities rather than replace expertise
- **Testing required**: Always manually test and validate generated code

#### Effective Prompting Strategies
- **Clear specifications**: Provide detailed function signatures and requirements
- **Specific instructions**: Tell the AI exactly what to do, don't assume understanding
- **Conversational iteration**: Refine results through back-and-forth dialogue
- **Multiple options**: Ask for several implementation approaches to compare

#### Context Management Best Practices
- **Context is king**: Previous conversation history significantly impacts results
- **Strategic resets**: Start fresh conversations when context becomes unhelpful
- **Seed with examples**: Provide existing code or patterns to establish context
- **Maintain focus**: Keep conversations on-topic for better results

#### Validation and Testing Workflows
- **Always test**: Never assume generated code works without verification
- **Incremental validation**: Test components as they're built rather than at the end
- **Safe execution**: Use tools that can run generated code in isolated environments
- **Error feedback**: Share test failures with AI for iterative improvement

#### Advanced Usage Patterns
- **Prototyping accelerator**: Excellent for rapid prototyping and exploration
- **Codebase exploration**: Use for understanding unfamiliar architectures and patterns
- **Pair programming assistant**: Treat as an over-confident but knowledgeable partner
- **Research and learning**: Leverage for exploring new technologies and approaches

### Key Industry Insights

#### Common Patterns for Success
1. **Incremental approach**: Build and validate small pieces rather than large complete solutions
2. **Clear boundaries**: Understand what LLMs excel at vs. where human expertise is essential
3. **Tool optimization**: Design development tools and processes that work well with AI assistance
4. **Context preservation**: Maintain conversation context while knowing when to reset
5. **Testing discipline**: Never skip validation steps, regardless of how confident the AI seems

#### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- **Don't assume correctness**: LLMs can be confidently wrong about technical details
- **Beware of training cutoffs**: Be aware of model knowledge limitations for newer technologies
- **Manage complexity**: Keep code simple enough for AI to understand and maintain
- **Avoid over-reliance**: Maintain your own technical skills and judgment

#### Emerging Best Practices
- **Parallelization**: Explore running multiple AI sessions for different aspects of a project
- **Specialized workflows**: Develop custom prompts and processes for recurring tasks
- **Tool integration**: Build AI assistance into existing development tools and pipelines
- **Continuous adaptation**: Stay flexible as AI coding capabilities evolve rapidly

## Community Insights & Resources

The most effective mental model is treating Claude Code as **a very fast intern with perfect memory** who:
- Is eager to help and incredibly capable
- Remembers everything perfectly within a session
- Still needs clear direction and occasional supervision
- Can work at superhuman speed when properly guided
- Allows you to focus on creative work requiring your expertise

### Enhanced Thinking Modes (Community-Discovered)

#### Thinking Hierarchy
Progressive levels of thinking depth:
- `think` (basic reasoning)
- `think hard` (deeper analysis)
- `think harder` (comprehensive reasoning)
- `ultrathink` (maximum reasoning budget)

Alternative phrases that work:
- "think more", "think a lot", "think longer"
- Thinking works in non-English languages
- Use `DISABLE_INTERLEAVED_THINKING` to opt out if needed

#### Strategic Thinking Usage
```bash
claude "ultrathink about the architecture for this microservices system, considering scalability, fault tolerance, and team boundaries"
```

### Proven Workflow Patterns

#### Explore → Plan → Execute Pattern
1. **Explore**: Ask Claude to read files, images, URLs without writing code
2. **Plan**: Request detailed, step-by-step implementation plan
3. **Execute**: Implement the plan iteratively with concrete targets

#### Session Management Best Practices
- Use `/clear` frequently when starting new tasks
- Prevents token waste from unnecessary conversation history
- Strategic use of `--continue` for resuming important contexts
- Consider `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for faster workflows (Cursor yolo mode equivalent)

#### Visual Content Integration
- **macOS shortcuts**: `cmd+ctrl+shift+4` → clipboard screenshot, `ctrl+v` to paste
- **Drag-and-drop**: Images directly into prompt input
- **Design workflow**: Upload mockups, iterate on implementation

### Community-Proven Tips

#### Cost and Efficiency Management
- Clear chat history regularly to avoid expensive compaction calls
- Use filesystem for persistent information instead of conversation memory
- Leverage Claude's perfect memory within sessions effectively

#### Code Quality Assurance
- Always verify every line of code Claude produces
- Despite high accuracy, human verification remains essential
- Use Claude's explanation capabilities for complex code understanding

#### Advanced Feature Usage
- **Parallel tool execution**: Invoke all relevant tools simultaneously
- **MCP integration**: Connect external data sources (Google Drive, Figma, Slack)
- **Scriptable workflows**: `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see anomalies"`
