## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 18 or newer** is required
- Install globally: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`

### Core Philosophy
- Works directly in your terminal (not another chat window)
- Tell Claude what you want to build in plain English
- Meets developers "where you already work"
- Can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines and custom tooling

### Basic Usage
```bash
cd your-project-directory
claude
```

## Core Workflow Patterns

### 1. Understanding New Codebases
- **Start broad**: Ask about project structure and architecture
- **Dive specific**: Request explanations of coding conventions and patterns
- **Build context**: Ask for a glossary of project-specific terms
- **Use navigation**: Leverage `@` to quickly reference files and directories

### 2. Problem-Solving Approach
- **Be specific**: Share exact error messages and reproduction steps
- **Ask for options**: Request multiple fix recommendations
- **Verify changes**: Always run tests after implementations
- **Incremental changes**: Refactor in small, testable increments

### 3. Code Navigation Techniques
- Use `@filename` or `@directory/` for quick file references
- Ask Claude to find relevant code files for specific functionality
- Trace execution flows and component interactions
- Identify legacy or deprecated code for modernization

### 4. Advanced Workflows
- **Extended thinking**: Use keywords like 'think', 'think harder', or 'ultrathink' for deeper analysis
- **Resume conversations**: Use `--continue` and `--resume` flags to pick up previous sessions
- **Custom slash commands**: Create reusable commands in `.claude/commands/` directories
- **Parallel sessions**: Use Git worktrees for multiple concurrent tasks
- **Real-time interaction**: Send additional messages while Claude is working by hitting Enter

## Memory Management

### Memory Types & Hierarchy
1. **Project memory** (`./CLAUDE.md`): Team-shared instructions
2. **User memory** (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`): Personal preferences across projects
3. **Deprecated**: Local project memory (`./CLAUDE.local.md`)

### Best Practices for Memory
- **Be specific**: Use precise instructions like "Use 2-space indentation"
- **Structure well**: Use markdown with bullet points and headings
- **Review regularly**: Periodically update memories for relevance
- **Import additional files**: Use `@path/to/import` syntax
- **Quick additions**: Start input with `#` to quickly add to Claude's memory
- **Use `/memory` command**: Edit memory files directly in your system editor

### Recommended Memory Content
```markdown
# Project Guidelines
- Use 2-space indentation for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow conventional commit format
- Run `npm test` before committing
- Use kebab-case for component files

# Frequently Used Commands
- Test command: `npm test`
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Lint command: `npm run lint`

# Architecture Notes
- API endpoints in `/src/api/`
- React components in `/src/components/`
- Utilities in `/src/utils/`
```

## Configuration & Settings

### Configuration Hierarchy
Settings are applied in order of precedence:
1. Enterprise policies (managed by system administrators)
2. Command line arguments
3. Local project settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
4. Shared project settings (`.claude/settings.json`)
5. User settings (`~/.claude/settings.json`)

### Key Configuration Areas

#### Essential Settings
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allowedCommands": ["npm", "git", "pytest"],
    "restrictedDirectories": ["/etc", "/usr"]
  },
  "env": {
    "NODE_ENV": "development",
    "DEBUG": "true"
  },
  "hooks": {
    "beforeToolCall": "echo 'Running tool...'",
    "afterToolCall": "echo 'Tool completed'"
  }
}
```

#### Configuration Management Commands
```bash
claude config list                    # List all settings
claude config get permissions         # View specific setting
claude config set model claude-3-5    # Change a setting
claude config set --global model ...  # Set global configuration
```

## IDE Integrations

### Supported IDEs
- **Visual Studio Code** (and forks: Cursor, Windsurf, VSCodium)
- **JetBrains IDEs** (IntelliJ, PyCharm, Android Studio, etc.)
- **Any IDE with terminal access**

### Key Features
- **Quick launch**: Keyboard shortcut (Cmd/Ctrl+Esc)
- **Context sharing**: Automatic sharing from current IDE selection/tab
- **Diff viewing**: View changes directly in IDE
- **File references**: Quick file navigation shortcuts
- **Error sharing**: Automatic diagnostic error sharing

### Setup Best Practices
1. **Install from project root**: Always run `claude` from your project's root directory
2. **Use integrated terminal**: Run Claude in the IDE's built-in terminal
3. **Configure diff tool**: Set to "auto" for automatic IDE detection
4. **Restart completely**: After plugin installation, fully restart your IDE

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure CLI commands are available in PATH
- Check plugin/extension permissions
- Verify running from correct project directory
- Use `/config` command to adjust IDE-specific preferences

## Model Context Protocol (MCP)

### MCP Overview
MCP enables Claude to access external tools and data sources through specialized servers.

### Server Scope Best Practices
- **Local scope**: Personal servers and experimental configurations
- **Project scope**: Team-shared servers and collaboration tools  
- **User scope**: Personal utilities across multiple projects

### Security Considerations
- **Use caution**: Third-party MCP servers carry inherent risks
- **Minimize exposure**: Be cautious with internet-connected servers
- **Guard against injection**: Watch for potential prompt injection risks
- **Start read-only**: Begin with read-only access for sensitive systems

### Configuration Tips
```bash
# Add MCP servers
claude mcp add server-name command-to-run

# Reference resources
@server:protocol://resource/path

# Use server prompts as slash commands
/server-command
```

### Authentication Best Practices
- Use OAuth 2.0 for remote servers
- Securely store authentication tokens
- Enable automatic token refresh
- Configure appropriate timeout values

## Security Best Practices

### Core Security Principles
- **Read-only by default**: Strict permissions with explicit approval required
- **Folder restrictions**: Access limited to current project directory
- **Command allowlisting**: Approve safe commands explicitly
- **Accept Edits mode**: Controlled change approval workflow

### Prompt Injection Prevention
- **Explicit approval**: Required for sensitive operations
- **Context analysis**: Automatic detection of harmful instructions
- **Input sanitization**: Automatic cleaning of user inputs
- **Web-fetch blocking**: Risky web commands are blocked

### User Security Practices
- **Review commands**: Always verify suggested commands before approval
- **Avoid untrusted input**: Don't pipe untrusted content directly to Claude
- **Verify critical changes**: Double-check modifications to important files
- **Use virtual machines**: For external tool calls and testing
- **Report issues**: Alert Anthropic to suspicious behavior

### Additional Safeguards
- Network request approval by default
- Isolated context windows for web operations
- Trust verification for new codebases
- Secure credential storage (e.g., macOS Keychain)
- Fail-closed command matching
- XDG_CONFIG_HOME compliance for organized configuration
- 30-day data retention policy for feedback transcripts
- No training data usage from user interactions

## Monitoring & Usage Tracking

### OpenTelemetry Integration
Enable comprehensive monitoring with environment variables:

```bash
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=1
export OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint
export OTEL_METRICS_INCLUDE_SESSION_ID=true
```

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Usage metrics**: Session counts, active development time
- **Code changes**: Modifications, pull requests, commits
- **Performance**: Token usage, API request costs
- **Tool usage**: Decision patterns and tool effectiveness

### Configuration Best Practices
- **Start simple**: Begin with console debugging
- **Gradual enhancement**: Add sophisticated exporters incrementally
- **Control cardinality**: Manage performance and storage costs
- **Enterprise setup**: Use managed settings for centralized configuration

### Security Considerations
- Telemetry is opt-in by default
- Sensitive information is not logged
- User prompt content is redacted unless explicitly enabled

## Advanced Features

### Extended Thinking
For complex problems requiring deeper analysis:
```bash
claude --thinking-depth deep
```

### Resume Conversations
Continue previous sessions:
```bash
claude --continue
```

### Custom Slash Commands
Create reusable command patterns:
```bash
/deploy    # Custom deployment command
/test-all  # Comprehensive testing suite
/review    # Code review checklist
```

### Parallel Development
Use Git worktrees for concurrent work:
```bash
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
cd ../feature-branch
claude  # Work on feature in parallel
```

### CI/CD Integration
Use Claude as a code reviewer or linter:
```bash
# In CI pipeline
claude --output json "Review this PR for security issues"
```

### Data Processing
Pipe data through Claude for analysis:
```bash
cat logs.txt | claude "Summarize error patterns"
```

- **Review configs**: Check settings hierarchy and precedence
- **Test incrementally**: Make small changes and test frequently

## Engineering Best Practices

These advanced patterns come from Anthropic's engineering team experience:

### Multi-Claude Workflows
- **Parallel instances**: Run multiple Claude sessions for different tasks simultaneously
- **Git worktrees**: Use separate worktrees to enable independent concurrent work
  ```bash
  git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
  cd ../feature-branch
  claude  # Work on feature while main Claude handles other tasks
  ```
- **Division of labor**: Have one Claude write code while another reviews or tests it
- **Specialized sessions**: Dedicate different Claude instances to specific domains (frontend, backend, testing)

### Context and Prompt Optimization
- **Persistent context**: Create comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` files for long-term project knowledge
- **Quick documentation**: Use `#` prefix to rapidly document commands and guidelines
- **Prompt experimentation**: Try different phrasings to improve model adherence and output quality
- **Clear targets**: Provide visual mocks, test cases, or specific outputs for Claude to iterate against
- **Iterative refinement**: Plan for 2-3 iterations to significantly improve output quality

### Advanced Development Strategies
- **Visual-driven development**: Use screenshots and UI mocks for better frontend development
- **Test-driven development**: Implement TDD workflows with Claude writing tests first
- **Extended reasoning**: Use "think" modes to trigger deeper analysis for complex problems
- **Subagent verification**: Leverage Claude's ability to verify its own complex problem-solving
- **Custom automation**: Create slash commands and hooks for repeated engineering workflows

### Production and CI/CD Integration
- **Headless automation**: Use headless mode for CI/infrastructure automation
  ```bash
  claude --headless "Review this PR for security issues and output JSON report"
  ```
- **Isolated execution**: Run potentially dangerous operations in containers or VMs
- **Permission boundaries**: Carefully scope tool permissions for production environments
- **Automated reviews**: Integrate Claude into code review processes with specific criteria

### Hook System for Advanced Customization
Claude Code's Hook System provides powerful extensibility points for custom workflows and security validation:

#### Available Hooks
- **`UserPromptSubmit`**: Triggered when user submits a prompt; can process input or add working directory context
- **`PreToolUse`**: Critical for security - validates commands before tool execution
- **`PreCompact`**: Runs before conversation compaction for cleanup or context management
- **`Stop` and `SubagentStop`**: Triggered on process completion for transcript handling and follow-up actions

#### Hook Configuration
- Configure with optional timeout settings for each command
- Hook events include `hook_event_name` for context about which event triggered
- Essential for implementing custom security policies and workflow automation

#### Security Validation with Hooks
```bash
# Example PreToolUse hook for command validation
# Place hook scripts in your configuration directory
# Hooks can approve/deny tool execution based on security policies
```

### Enhanced Custom Slash Commands
Beyond basic slash commands, Claude Code supports advanced patterns:

#### Command Organization
- **Location**: Place Markdown files in `.claude/commands/` directories
- **Namespacing**: Subdirectories create namespaces (e.g., `.claude/commands/frontend/component.md` → `/frontend:component`)
- **Team sharing**: Commit command directories to share workflows across teams

#### Advanced Command Features
- **Bash output integration**: Include live command output within commands
- **File references**: Use `@-mention` syntax to automatically include files in context
- **Thinking mode triggers**: Include keywords to enable deeper reasoning
- **Argument hints**: Use frontmatter in Markdown for parameter documentation
- **Multi-language support**: Thinking mode works in non-English languages

#### Example Custom Command Structure
```markdown
---
args:
  - name: component_name
    description: Name of the React component to create
---

# Create React Component

Create a new React component named {{component_name}} following our project conventions:

@src/components/BaseComponent.tsx
@docs/component-guidelines.md

think harder about the component structure and dependencies
```

### Performance and Efficiency Patterns
- **Batch operations**: Combine multiple related tasks in single Claude sessions
- **Context reuse**: Leverage memory and configuration to avoid repeating setup
- **Resource optimization**: Monitor token usage and optimize prompt efficiency
- **Incremental development**: Build features in small, testable chunks with immediate feedback

### Key Engineering Insight
> "Claude performs best when it has a clear target to iterate against—a visual mock, a test case, or another kind of output." 
> — Anthropic Engineering Team

This principle should guide how you structure tasks and provide context to Claude for optimal results.

## Industry Expert Insights

These patterns emerge from experienced practitioners using AI coding tools in production environments.

### Agentic Coding Patterns (Armin Ronacher)

#### Workflow Philosophy
- **Full permission approach**: Use AI agents with comprehensive permissions to minimize human interruption
- **Token efficiency**: Optimize for fast tool responses and efficient token usage
- **Code simplicity**: Prioritize simple, stable, and observable code over complex abstractions

#### Language and Technology Choices
- **Go for backends**: Explicit context system, straightforward test caching, structural interfaces, low ecosystem churn
- **Avoid complex ORMs**: Prefer plain SQL for clarity and AI understanding
- **Minimize dependencies**: Favor code generation over adding external dependencies

#### Tool Design for AI
- **Fast, user-friendly tools**: Build tools that handle unexpected AI behavior gracefully
- **Extensive logging**: Help agents diagnose issues and navigate codebases effectively
- **Process management**: Prevent duplicate service launches and resource conflicts
- **Stable interfaces**: Design APIs that work reliably with AI-generated code

#### Code Design Principles
- **"Dumbest possible thing"**: Write the simplest code that works effectively
- **Clear function names**: Prefer descriptive functions over complex class hierarchies
- **Local visibility**: Keep important checks (permissions, validation) visible and local
- **Proactive refactoring**: Refactor as project complexity grows to maintain AI comprehension

### LLM Coding Effectiveness (Simon Willison)

#### Realistic Expectations
- **Fancy autocomplete**: Treat LLMs as sophisticated autocomplete, not perfect code generators
- **Augmentation tool**: Use to enhance your abilities rather than replace expertise
- **Testing required**: Always manually test and validate generated code

#### Effective Prompting Strategies
- **Clear specifications**: Provide detailed function signatures and requirements
- **Specific instructions**: Tell the AI exactly what to do, don't assume understanding
- **Conversational iteration**: Refine results through back-and-forth dialogue
- **Multiple options**: Ask for several implementation approaches to compare

#### Context Management Best Practices
- **Context is king**: Previous conversation history significantly impacts results
- **Strategic resets**: Start fresh conversations when context becomes unhelpful
- **Seed with examples**: Provide existing code or patterns to establish context
- **Maintain focus**: Keep conversations on-topic for better results

#### Validation and Testing Workflows
- **Always test**: Never assume generated code works without verification
- **Incremental validation**: Test components as they're built rather than at the end
- **Safe execution**: Use tools that can run generated code in isolated environments
- **Error feedback**: Share test failures with AI for iterative improvement

#### Advanced Usage Patterns
- **Prototyping accelerator**: Excellent for rapid prototyping and exploration
- **Codebase exploration**: Use for understanding unfamiliar architectures and patterns
- **Pair programming assistant**: Treat as an over-confident but knowledgeable partner
- **Research and learning**: Leverage for exploring new technologies and approaches

### Key Industry Insights

#### Common Patterns for Success
1. **Incremental approach**: Build and validate small pieces rather than large complete solutions
2. **Clear boundaries**: Understand what LLMs excel at vs. where human expertise is essential
3. **Tool optimization**: Design development tools and processes that work well with AI assistance
4. **Context preservation**: Maintain conversation context while knowing when to reset
5. **Testing discipline**: Never skip validation steps, regardless of how confident the AI seems

#### Avoiding Common Pitfalls
- **Don't assume correctness**: LLMs can be confidently wrong about technical details
- **Beware of training cutoffs**: Be aware of model knowledge limitations for newer technologies
- **Manage complexity**: Keep code simple enough for AI to understand and maintain
- **Avoid over-reliance**: Maintain your own technical skills and judgment

#### Emerging Best Practices
- **Parallelization**: Explore running multiple AI sessions for different aspects of a project
- **Specialized workflows**: Develop custom prompts and processes for recurring tasks
- **Tool integration**: Build AI assistance into existing development tools and pipelines
- **Continuous adaptation**: Stay flexible as AI coding capabilities evolve rapidly

## Enterprise Security & Compliance Enforcement

For enterprise environments requiring strict control over software dependencies, container images, and development tools, Claude Code can be configured with comprehensive enforcement mechanisms.

### Security Enforcement Mental Model
Think of Claude as **your compliance enforcement partner** who can:
- Validate all dependencies against approved whitelists
- Enforce container image policies and registry restrictions
- Implement automated security scanning and approval workflows
- Generate compliance reports and audit trails
- Block non-compliant software installation attempts

### Software and Package Whitelisting

#### Package Manager Enforcement
Claude Code can enforce package whitelists through multiple mechanisms:

**NPM/Node.js Package Controls:**
```json
// .claude/settings.json - Package whitelist enforcement
{
  "security": {
    "packageWhitelist": {
      "enabled": true,
      "allowedPackages": [
        "react",
        "react-dom",
        "@types/react",
        "express",
        "typescript",
        "jest",
        "@testing-library/*"
      ],
      "approvedRegistries": [
        "https://registry.npmjs.org/",
        "https://npm.internal.company.com/"
      ],
      "blockUnauthorized": true
    }
  }
}
```

**Python Package Controls:**
```bash
# Use Claude to generate enforcement scripts
claude "Create a pip install wrapper that validates packages against our whitelist before installation"

# Example generated enforcement script
#!/bin/bash
ALLOWED_PACKAGES=(
  "django>=4.0,<5.0"
  "psycopg2-binary"
  "celery"
  "redis"
  "pytest"
  "black"
  "flake8"
)

if [[ ! " ${ALLOWED_PACKAGES[@]} " =~ " ${1} " ]]; then
  echo "ERROR: Package ${1} not in approved whitelist"
  exit 1
fi
pip install "${1}"
```

#### Pre-commit Hook Enforcement
```bash
# Generate comprehensive pre-commit validation
claude "Create pre-commit hooks that validate all package.json changes against our approved dependency list"

# Example hook script
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
WHITELIST_FILE=".claude/approved-packages.json"
PACKAGE_FILE="package.json"

if [ -f "$PACKAGE_FILE" ]; then
  # Extract new dependencies
  ADDED_DEPS=$(git diff --cached "$PACKAGE_FILE" | grep '^+' | grep -E '"[^"]+":' | cut -d'"' -f2)
  
  for dep in $ADDED_DEPS; do
    if ! jq -e ".allowedPackages[] | select(. == \"$dep\")" "$WHITELIST_FILE" > /dev/null; then
      echo "ERROR: Dependency '$dep' not in approved whitelist"
      echo "Contact security team for approval: security@company.com"
      exit 1
    fi
  done
fi
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline Integration
```yaml
# GitHub Actions - Package validation
name: Security Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate-dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Validate Package Dependencies
        run: |
          # Check package.json against whitelist
          npx @company/package-validator package.json .claude/approved-packages.json
          
      - name: Security Audit
        run: |
          npm audit --audit-level=moderate
          
      - name: License Compliance Check
        run: |
          npx license-checker --onlyAllow 'MIT;Apache-2.0;BSD-3-Clause'
```

### Container Image Whitelisting and Registry Controls

#### Approved Container Registry Enforcement
```bash
# Configure Claude to only allow approved registries
claude "Configure our Docker and Kubernetes manifests to only use images from our approved enterprise registries"

{
  "containerSecurity": {
    "approvedRegistries": [
      "registry.company.com",
      "quay.io/company",
      "gcr.io/company-project"
    ],
    "approvedBaseImages": [
      "registry.company.com/base/ubuntu:20.04-secure",
      "registry.company.com/base/node:18-alpine-secure",
      "registry.company.com/base/python:3.11-slim-secure"
    ],
    "blockPublicRegistries": true,
    "requireSignedImages": true
  }
}
```

#### Dockerfile Validation and Enforcement
```bash
# Generate Dockerfile linting rules
claude "Create Dockerfile validation rules that enforce our approved base images and security practices"

# Example validation script
#!/bin/bash

# Check base images
FROM_LINES=$(grep "^FROM" "$DOCKERFILE")
while IFS= read -r line; do
  IMAGE=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $2}' | cut -d':' -f1)
  
  APPROVED=false
  for registry in $APPROVED_REGISTRIES; do
    if [[ "$IMAGE" == *"$registry"* ]]; then
      APPROVED=true
      break
    fi
  done
  
  if [ "$APPROVED" = false ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Unapproved base image: $IMAGE"
    echo "Approved registries: $APPROVED_REGISTRIES"
    exit 1
  fi
done <<< "$FROM_LINES"
```

#### Kubernetes Security Policies

```bash
# Generate OPA policies for container image validation
claude "Create OPA policies that validate Kubernetes deployments against our approved container image whitelist"

# Example OPA policy
package kubernetes.admission

deny[msg] {
  input.request.kind.kind == "Pod"
  input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image
  image := input.request.object.spec.containers[_].image
  not approved_image(image)
  msg := sprintf("Image '%v' is not from an approved registry", [image])
}

approved_image(image) {
  approved_registries := [
    "registry.company.com",
    "quay.io/company",
    "gcr.io/company-project"
  ]
  startswith(image, approved_registries[_])
}
```

### Automated Compliance and Security Scanning

## Community Insights & Resources

Based on community experience and additional research, here are proven patterns from Claude Code practitioners.

### Community Mental Model: "Fast Intern with Perfect Memory"

The most effective mental model is treating Claude Code as **a very fast intern with perfect memory** who:
- Is eager to help and incredibly capable
- Remembers everything perfectly within a session
- Still needs clear direction and occasional supervision
- Can work at superhuman speed when properly guided
- Allows you to focus on creative work requiring your expertise

### Enhanced Thinking Modes (Community-Discovered)

#### Thinking Hierarchy
Progressive levels of thinking depth:
- `think` (basic reasoning)
- `think hard` (deeper analysis)
- `think harder` (comprehensive reasoning)
- `ultrathink` (maximum reasoning budget)

Alternative phrases that work:
- "think more", "think a lot", "think longer"
- Thinking works in non-English languages
- Use `DISABLE_INTERLEAVED_THINKING` to opt out if needed

#### Strategic Thinking Usage
```bash
claude "ultrathink about the architecture for this microservices system, considering scalability, fault tolerance, and team boundaries"
```

### Proven Workflow Patterns

#### Explore → Plan → Execute Pattern
1. **Explore**: Ask Claude to read files, images, URLs without writing code
2. **Plan**: Request detailed, step-by-step implementation plan
3. **Execute**: Implement the plan iteratively with concrete targets

#### Session Management Best Practices
- Use `/clear` frequently when starting new tasks
- Prevents token waste from unnecessary conversation history
- Strategic use of `--continue` for resuming important contexts
- Consider `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for faster workflows (Cursor yolo mode equivalent)

#### Visual Content Integration
- **macOS shortcuts**: `cmd+ctrl+shift+4` → clipboard screenshot, `ctrl+v` to paste
- **Drag-and-drop**: Images directly into prompt input
- **Design workflow**: Upload mockups, iterate on implementation

### Community-Proven Tips

#### Cost and Efficiency Management
- Clear chat history regularly to avoid expensive compaction calls
- Use filesystem for persistent information instead of conversation memory
- Leverage Claude's perfect memory within sessions effectively

#### Code Quality Assurance
- Always verify every line of code Claude produces
- Despite high accuracy, human verification remains essential
- Use Claude's explanation capabilities for complex code understanding

#### Advanced Feature Usage
- **Parallel tool execution**: Invoke all relevant tools simultaneously
- **MCP integration**: Connect external data sources (Google Drive, Figma, Slack)
- **Scriptable workflows**: `tail -f app.log | claude -p "Slack me if you see anomalies"`
